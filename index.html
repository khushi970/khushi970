    <h1> KARTIK ARYAN </h1>
    <p>Kartik Aaryan Tiwari[1] (born 22 November 1990) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. While pursuing an engineering degree in biotechnology, he dabbled in modeling and made attempts to start a career in film. After struggling for three years, he made his acting debut in 2011 with Pyaar Ka Punchnama, a buddy film about the romantic tribulations faced by three young men, which was directed by Luv Ranjan and co-starred Nushrat Bharucha.

        Following a brief setback, Aaryan subsequently collaborated with Ranjan and Bharucha in two more buddy films, Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 (2015) and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (2018), both of which were commercially successful but received criticism for their misogynistic themes. The latter proved to be a break the pugh for Aaryan, and he followed it by starring in the 2019 romantic comedies Luka Chuppi and Pati Patni Aur Woh. </p>
